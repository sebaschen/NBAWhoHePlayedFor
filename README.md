### Inspiration: 
From the famous NBA TNT show hosted from Shaq, Charles, Kenny, Ernest, they hosted a game for Charles Barkley, named ["Who he played for?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuJGzw8rzSs&ab_channel=NBAonTNT)
The purpose of this game is to show how much you know in the new season, which teams are these players played for.

Each new season, there will be a new chance for Charles Barkley to earn redemption in "Who He Play For?"


The first version of my porgram will be which team for the players drafed from NBA lottery 1995 to 2020 in the lottery picks.

GOAL:
